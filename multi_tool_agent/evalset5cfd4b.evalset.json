Here's a summary of the key points and potential troubleshooting steps:\n\n*   **Dashboard Element Count Discrepancies:** One thread discusses a discrepancy in the number of `dashboard_element` entries between a specific system activity and the out-of-the-box (OOTB) data. The root cause was identified as filters.\n*   **Filters as a Cause:** The results highlight that filters applied in the queries can lead to discrepancies. It's crucial to ensure that the same filters are applied when comparing data from different sources (e.g., front-end dashboard vs. DW data).\n*   **Query ID and Matching:** There's a suggestion to match data using `qid` (query ID) to find direct matches between the front-end and system activity data.\n*   **Data Source and Views:** The search results mention different system activity views that contain count measures, such as `dashboard`, `dashboard_element`, `history`, etc.\n*   **History Table:** The `history` table is mentioned, and there's a discussion about the expected record count and potential issues with the data.\n*   **Scheduled Plan Destination:** One of the discussions is about `scheduled_plan_destination` in system activity.\n\nBased on these findings, here are some troubleshooting steps you can take:\n\n1.  **Compare Filters:** Carefully compare the filters applied in the front-end dashboard queries with those used in the DW data extraction. Ensure they are consistent.\n2.  **Check Data Sources:** Identify the specific tables or views used in the front-end dashboard and the DW data.\n3.  **Query ID Matching:** If possible, use the query ID (`qid`) to trace the queries from the front-end to the system activity data to find matching entries.\n4.  **Investigate Dashboard Elements:** If the discrepancy is related to dashboard elements, investigate the filters and the `is_deleted_loaded_at` and `is_deleted_deleted_time` fields to see if there are any data deletions or modifications.\n5.  **Review History Data:** If history data is involved, check the record counts and ensure that the data is complete and accurate.\n6.  **Validate Definitions:** Make sure you understand the definitions of each metric being compared. For example, clarify the definition of a \"dashboard run\" in your context.\n7.  **Check for Data Modification:** Check whether data has been modified or deleted in the DW.\n\nI can help you further if you can provide more details on the specific discrepancies you're seeing, the tables/views involved, and the filters applied.\n"
